# 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Malik Muhammad Abdullah Younas**, but you can just call me **Abdullah**.  
I'm a **19-year-old Computer Science student from Pakistan** with a passion for building things — whether it’s a game, a website, or a small tool that solves a simple problem.

I've been creating projects since I was 10, but I really started taking it seriously around the age of 17. Since then, I’ve built a wide range of stuff — from browser extensions and web apps to real-time chat platforms and experimental games.

I love making games in **Unreal Engine 4**, especially because of how flexible and powerful it is. Game development is where I get to be the most creative.  
On the web dev side, I mostly focus on front-end development, but I’m also comfortable with back-end tools like **Firebase** and **Supabase**.

## 🛠 Tech I Use:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React, Three.js  
- C++, Java  
- Firebase, Supabase  
- Unreal Engine

I enjoy learning new things, shipping small ideas fast, and always trying to level up my skills — one project at a time.
